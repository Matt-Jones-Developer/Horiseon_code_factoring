# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactoring for Horiseon Inc.

## Description

This repository serves as a code refactoring example for marketing agency, Horiseon Inc.
Accessibility is extremely important so I wanted to make sure I was taking the companies existing code, improving it (refactoring), cleaning it up (Scout Rule) and making sure it was more legible and understandable for anyone within the company to see.

The criteria for this project are listed within the Acceptance Criteria section of this readme guide. A full list of changes can be found in the 'Commits' section. In future I will always write detailed commit comments.

## Acceptance Criteria

The website must meet accessibility standards. I have achieved this by completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## Commits

I have learnt from this project to make more detailed commit comments as mine were too vague.  I will list the actual changes here in more detail and improve on this next time.

1. Initial repo created and cloned 
2. Initial refactoring - changed title, added header and nav semantics
3. Added more semantic elements, including main and sections and footer and declared class names.
4. Switched the footer H2 tag to an H3 and corrected the text-sizing
5. Changed content section div classes to id's to allow for working links
6. Added alt tags for the remaining images 
7. Grouped the ids for the left boxes into one group
8. Removed navbar ul as it wasn't required, consolidated unnecessary CSS selectors 
9. Merged the renamed 'benefits' classes together 
10. Added additional meta tags, 'http-equiv' and 'name'
11. Changed the class names for 'right side panel' to 'benefits' and 'benefits-info'
12. Added comments to both the CSS and the HTML documents for improved readability
13. Improved the repo title, added a screenshot image for the readme
14. Added a professional readme document
